Urban Sound Classification
 Audio classification is an important area of interest with multiple applications in medical, industrial, multimedia and environmental domain. Sound or audio is also considered to be the integral part of security and video based surveillance systems. Sound can be represented as raw wave form and spectrogram. Different approaches are being used to build and train neural networks like convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks for the identification of Urbansounds. The  purpose of this study is to classify sound using two approaches , one on the basis of raw audio by a convolutional neural network and second on the basis of spectrogrms. Then performance comparison of two approaches is done. Performance is compared on the basis of accuracy, precision and re-call. audio and image classification of same data set i.e. UrbanSound8k. For audio original data set will be used. For image based audio classification spectrograms of original data set are generated and classified by GoogLeNet.

Urban Sound Classification
 Audio classification is an important area of interest with multiple applications in medical, industrial,
multimedia and environmental domain. Sound or audio is also considered to be the integral part
of security and video based surveillance systems. The idea is to make a comparison of audio and
image classification of same data set i.e. UrbanSound8k. For audio original data set will be used.
For image based audio classification spectrograms of original data set are used.
